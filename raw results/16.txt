okay helicopters and welcome to the very last lecture in the section of the course Tec through summer election in here we're just going to summarize everything we've learned in this section of the coolest now if you have done a Solutions architect associate course are you will notice that they easy to section of the developer associate course is quite a bit shorter and that's because the new developer associate exam is actually really serverless focused on so they really trying to get away from ac2 so you don't need to know anywhere near as much about ec2 as you did when you were doing the solutions architect cost we will have a whole section on civiles a coming up so let's go through my exam tips and we will start with the different types of Revenue models for ec2 pricing models for AC to fix right by the hour or by the second with no commitment without reserved which provides you with a capacity reservation and you have basically one to three-year contract if you pay what you going to do the professional levels it is really useful and if you are going to work with AWS anyway I'm it is pretty useful to know the different ec2 instance types then moved on and we looked at the different EBS volume so we had SSD so we had general-purpose SSD this is what we've been using throughout most of the course then have provision diop's and this is for mission-critical low-latency workload so basically anything of it 16000 Isle provision dial anything but low you can go with general-purpose SSD and then head magnetic OptimEyes in the console play balances we left about the three different types of low balances to the application load balancers Network load balances and classic low balances if you do see the word elastic load balancer typically they will be talking about classic load balances we learnt that we get a 504 error on a classic load balances this means the gateways timed out why is the Gateway X Out was not because the the OB is broken I'm essentially is timing out means there's something wrong with the application stack so could be a web applications what could be a database of us something is not working in that and the Gateway is timing out you need to go and troubleshoot your application stack Bill said that if you need the ipv4 address of your end user than you going to do this through the exported for head up moving on this Route 53 you always want to give you a uses the minimum amount of access required you may not want to give your dad's administrator access you may want to restrict it a little bit more Centralia out to your organization will to learn that we should create groups so you should have shown your uses two groups and you uses will automatically inherit the commission's of the group The Group permissions are signed using policy document lent about in terms of there so we learnt that you are only going to say this once and then just regenerated and if you do do that you're going to need to run the AWS config again and we also learned that you shouldn't use just one access K1 access Kia crossover all of you develop his crossover the stack of so always create one key pepper developers and remember that you can use the CLI on your PC I see you can install this on Mac Linux or Windows I actually use this you know to store my files in S3 so go ahead if you haven't done that already I suggest Googling the context of weed in your AWS environment always choose rolls on rolls control by policies you can change the policy on a roll it's going to take an immediate effect and you can attach and detach rolls to running ec2 instances without having to stop Altima night these instances then went about encryption or device volume Swedeland that you can eat the root device volume which is simply the operating system that the volume is stored on stove and you can do this using operating system level encryption settings like Windows BitLocker for example you can also encrypt device volume by first taking a snapshot of that then basically took that snap and created an Amazon machine image out of that snap and deployed it and that basically encrypted the root device volume and you can also encrypt additional attached volume just simply using the console or the API about IDs which is basically for online transaction processing are we use Audi S4 things that will audience has the following technologies that has SQL Server my sequel postgresql Oracle Aurora and Maria DB and then we have Dynamite TV which is Amazon's nosql service we have red shift which is Amazon's episode of the online analytics data warehousing service and then we have elastic cash which is out in memory keishin engine and that consists of memcached day and it also consists of redness in terms of Amazon IDs IDs instances can be multiple availability zones and that is only for Disaster Recovery it's not improving performance or performance Improvement replicas read replicas I use for scaling you must have automatic backups turned on in order to deploy a red replica you can head out to fibery replicas a copies of any you can have read replicas ovary replicas but you got to watch out for latency each read replicas going to have its own DNA Sandpoint you can have a read replica now that has multiple availability zones and you can create replicas of multi AZ Source databases read replicas can also be promoted to their own databases but then breaks the replication and you have a read replica in a second region for my Sequel and Maria DB moving onto elasticache typically you're going to be given a scenario where a database is under a lot of stress load and you'll be off switch service you should use to alleviate this I'm yours it depends on the particular online analytical processing transactions on it and then it is really important to understand the difference is between memcached day and read us go into this exam you need to use my touch day if abdication is your primary goal going to keep things as simple as possible and you want to be able to scale out your you know your cash cards on plate you use redis if you have much more advanced data types if you're doing things like sorting and ranking such as leaderboards if date of availability zones is important to you then you want to use redis and if you need Pub sub capabilities than you also want to use redis what congratulations you've done really really well I hope you've learned a lot
