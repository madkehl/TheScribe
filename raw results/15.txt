okay hope by Bruce and welcome to this lecture going to look at the AWS systems manager parameter stool don't you to imagine the following scenario confidential information such as uses passwords license you need to basically pastas information to ec2 as either bootstrap script or could be using cloud formation or could be using land or whatever so how would you do this while the answer is with AWS systems manager parameter store so let's go and jump over to the balances it's a function that sits on the AC to it's not doesn't have its own section you'll be able to find it by scrolling all the way down here and you can say we've got systems manager this is so we got things like the Run command estate manager configuration compliance etcetera etcetera and then if we scroll down under the shed results as we've got out parameter store so let's go ahead and click on that you've never used it before you can get this special screen will go ahead and get started essentially we create a parameter we going to store sensitive data in that and then we're going to be able to access this parameter across a whole bunch of different Services you see the services in his so easy to run command cloudformation you can do it using Lambda etcetera etcetera so let's go ahead and get started string type medicine I can't go in and actually Buda value actually I can hear you so you can see the value inside the console but it depends on your levels of permission so you know people didn't have access to a seat over to go down and see about systems manager working with systems manager parameters in hell you can see how you can actually organize them into hierarchies how you can create them which we've just done tag them and then working with different versions of practical exam in the exams what is beyond the scope of this course but you definitely need to understand at a high level that you can use AWS systems manager as a way of storing sensitive information so what am I exam tips well if you cook confidential information such as you can still values as plain text or you can actually go in and encrypt the data using cameras and then you can use this day to buy referencing the other values using that name so the names do need to be unique assistant manager is probably going to be a better place to store it then putting it in a plain text file in S3 and giving it public rate of what it is at a high level. If you have any questions please let me know if not feel free to move on to the next lecture thank you
