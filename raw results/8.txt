I want to do is go ahead and get started now and we're going to go ahead and create a hosted Zone and we don't have any hosted zones what we might want to do first before we create is hosted zone is to go and register a domain so go in and register the main and click on register domain now you need to choose a domain name now. Comes are about $12 you can get something cheaper let's have a look at what the cheapest one is a $9 one way out to you what you want to buy it you can say there's so many different top-level domains now so I'm going to just go ahead and buy a. Come you can choose whatever it is you want and then you can just type in here go ahead and add it to my cart then I'm going to go down here and hit continue now we have to fill in oldest registrant information so I'm going to go ahead and do that you can do this yourself once that's done I'm going to go ahead and hit submit okay so I have gone ahead and fill that out I just need to agree to the terms and conditions it's going to send me an email to the registrant email address just to check that I actually on it and you won't be able to get off this screen until you verified that email okay so just go ahead and verify that email is just refresh the state is here and we can say that it has registered now I'm going to go ahead and hit go to Germaine's and you say that the status is domain registration in progress now doesn't normally take three days it depends what top-level domain name that you use pause the video and wait for this domain name to become available this is now available on weekends over the last few days so I had this is a few days later but you should be able to register it you know within a few hours it really depends on the top level domain dashboard and we click on hosted Zone you'll be able to see your domain in here so I'm A Cloud Guru. Come and what we can do is we can go ahead and go to our records sets and this is where we create a record exactly the same thing what we're doing is with saying where I'm A Cloud Guru. Cam is going to go so we just click on create recordset you'll be able to see the different types of Records in his so we've got a record cname record MX records AAA records Etc Sony record would point to an ipv4 address AAA wrecker of quadruple a record with points when IPv6 address etc etc I'm so what we going to do is we're going to create a address rather than www.icloud.com set is similar in some ways to a cname record set one of the differences is that you create an alias for the Zone Apex we create this for the naked domain name and this is basically is only supported by a and truck or AAA record to ipv4 IPv6 addresses so what we're going to do is click in here and we've got a different targets so you can have an alias Target for an S3 website for an elastic load balancer and application load balancer elastic load balancer classic load balancer elastic load balancer Network load balancer the website obitsu Services going to go over to ec2 and we should still have a little ec2 instance up and running that we created earlier I have no idea why but for some reason I'm in Oregon that was a little bit confusing so if you do not see your instant just check where you should be I should be back in Northern Virginia and yet I can see my instance there and then what you want to do in order to create a load balances if you go down to load balancing you see it right here prices for your application we're going to go ahead and create an application load balancer and here you might want to give it a name so I'm going to pull up my aob store application load balancer it's going to be it's going to be using ipv4 so here we have our listeners now listen to report our application load balancer is going to listen on sohi CDP is on 80 and if you want you can do it as well type in here at the little web page that we created index. HTML you leave everything else as default and we going to go in and register out targets something to add this to the registered group and then I'm going to go ahead and hit review and I'm going to go ahead and hit create now the health check will take a little while to bring this load balancer in the service is healthy I'm so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take a while to provision online 10th and delivery and we're going to click on that and what we're going to do is we're going to point out DNS R2L application load balancer so click in here and we'll go click on the link and you can see it here this is Out hosted zerns so can I create a recordset and we're going to do an alias record and in here will be able to see the target so here it is my real baby I'm going to click in there and I'm going to leave everything else as default and go ahead and hit create and so now what we going to do is going to open up a new tab I want to go to I'm A Cloud Guru. Com okay so here we are just going to open up a cloud Guru. Com and if we minimize their workers does Hillary klug website application load balancer application load balancer which is sending traffic to out ec2 instance so that is it for this lecture guys hopefully you blind to what the next lecture what we're going to do is going to look into our ec2 instance and we're going to show you how to set up a user so that they can access S3 using the command line and it's very important to understand how to do that going into your exams if you got the time please join me in the next Witcher thank you
