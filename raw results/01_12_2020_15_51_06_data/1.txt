hello Tom Cruise and welcome to this section of the course web it going to take a look at one of the most popular services that AWS has to offer which is easy to sew what is ec2 well it sounds for elastic compute cloud and it's abbreviated to ec2 so that is what the name that comes from an ec2 is secure resizable compute capacity in the cloud so what does that actually mean well it's basically like a virtual machine only it's hosted in AWS instead of being in your own Data Center and it's been designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers and weedy sea to you can have the capacity you want when you need it and you are in complete control of your own instances so you get root admin access to your own instances when we say instances it just basically means the actual machine that you are running in AWS so why is ec2 so cool well when AWS introduced easy to it was really a game-changer for the IT industry for a number of reasons and AWS a big change in the entire industry by being the very first cloud provider and by introducing ec2 of the first Foothill machine running in public Cloud you use so you only pay for the time when you're easy to instant is up and running so it's a pay-as-you-go model and its really changed the economics of computing and with easy to you should be able to avoid a lot of the wasted capacity which is inheritance and physical servers this is because with a C2 you can select the capacity that you need right now and you can grow and Shrink as and when you need so over time as the demands on your application change you can grow and shrink your infrastructure to suit the requirements of your business and your applications before easy to came on the scene if you had a new application and you have to purchase new physical servers you have to estimate how much capacity you were going to need when you're buying a physical server this is really a long-term investment for maybe three to five years or sometimes even longer so when I was working as a Solutions architect a lot of the time we would specify the physical servers with the expectation that the application will grow into it so think of all those companies all around the world Lisa centers with huge servers and all this wasted capacity but they're real benefit takes time so there's many stages we have to go through before we can actually install an application on also ever and this is why in some organizations depending on the level of Change Control and approval process involved at each of these pages in some cases it can take three months or longer to purchase a new server and have it up and running and ready for you to install your application for this go to be a better way and for me this is the big game changer with ec2 you can be up and running in minutes instead of waiting months so on to my exam tips for easy to just remember ac2 is like a virtual machine and it's hosted by AWS instead of being in your own face is Unser and the great thing about it is that you can select the capacity that you need right now you can grow and Shrink whatever you need you pay only for what you use and you get your infrastructure and it's ready so your application in minutes water than waiting months so that is the end of this lecture if you have any questions please do let me know otherwise feel free to move on to the next lecture thank you
