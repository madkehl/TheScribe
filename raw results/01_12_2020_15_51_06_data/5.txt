hello tacos and welcome to this lecture where we going to take a closer look at EBS volumes so fussy will look at what EBS volumes are and within going to cover the different types of EDS volume available and will also consider use cases for each different type of EBS volume and for the exam you'll need to understand the differences between the different types of EDS volume and when you would use them so ABS stands for elastic Block store and EBS volumes All Storage volumes which you can attach to your ec2 instances so here is on ec2 instance and hit is on EBS volume attached to on ec2 instance so they all storage or discs so just think of the discs in your laptop on your local computer when you first launch an ec2 instance it has at least one ABS volume attached and this is where your operating system is going to be installed so windows or Linux and then you can add more volumes depending on the needs of your application so how do you use these EBS volumes well you use them the same way you would any system disk for example you could create a file system and still some files in there maybe configuration files or any files you like you could use an EBS volume to run a database system stole any type of data that you like and you can install your applications on them as well so that take a look at some of the features of EDS and one of the great things about it is that it's designed for Higher One this is the high-performance option and it's also the most expensive so we the only one that you get up to 64,000 miles per volume and you get 50 oil sponge cake and this is the one to use if you need more than 16,000 oil spill application you know maybe you're installing an off-the-shelf application which specifies in the system requirements that you need to Grace it than at 16,000 oil and this is the one to choose or if you've developed your own application and interesting you discovered that you need a greater than 16,000 oiled then this is the one that's a go for so these are designed for iOS intensive applications so I think large databases and latency sensitive what clothes now in addition to only one they have recently announced io2 which is the latest generation call provision Doyle's EBS volumes in the exam but it's just good to know anyway so I'll tell you is the latest generation for provisioned oiled and the main thing to note is that you get higher durability and boiled egg but it's up to the same maximum of $64,000 per volume so it's more durable and more performance as well but in terms of cost it's actually the same price as I are one and you might be wondering why does it cost the same if it's so much better well I don't know for sure but my guess is that oil one will eventually become the Legacy option and oil to will become a standard so by making them the same price that encouraging people to start using oil to fry with ir to get 500 oil partick out of course with ir-1 it's only 50 up to a maximum of $64,000 per volume and in times of durability ir-2 is designed for 99.999% durability where is all of the other EDF volume types are designed for between 99.8 and 99.9% durability and suitable for applications databases and latency sensitive but also applications which need higher levels of your ability so if you have an application which needs a greater than 99.9% durability for its data then order to is the option to go for because this is the only option that's going to give you five nines of durability field day so now the next type of EBS volume without you'll need to know about is 3 foot optimize HDD and this is a hard disk drive is an HDD it's not an SSD so it's not a solid state drive and he is annoying as ST1 I need a great for storing huge amounts of data so I think mountains of data but you want to access the day so frequently and the performance of three put optimized ABS volume is measured in megabytes per second to terabyte so it with these you get a baseline throughput of 40 Megs per second per terabyte you've also got the ability to bust up to 250 megabits per second per terabyte with a maximum throughput of 500 Megs per second per volume so when would we use these kind of EVS phone Lisa grateful frequently accessed through put intensive what clothes so I think what clothes like big data data warehouse is ETL so extract transform load operations and lock processing so think not amounts of data that you are accessing frequently and you want high performance as well and it's a really cost-effective way to store mountains of data so if you got loads of dice at the store and it's frequently accessed than ST1 is the one to choose and these cannot be a boot volume so they will not allow you to select one of these as a boot volume and then finally we have the lowest cost option and this is cold HDD and it's also known as sc14 SC1 has a baseline at throughput of 12 Megs per second with the ability to stop 280 make per second per terabyte with a maximum throughput of 250 make per second volume so it's not as performance as the throughput optimized ST1 but it is a really good choice for colder days of so Daytona which requires a few scans today and it's also good for applications which need the lowest cost and for which performance is not so if you're running a job which could happen overnight or across a few days which involves accessing lots of data and you don't necessarily need a super fast response then this could be a good option and also the code HD dac1 that cannot be a boot volume and throughput and what is the difference well-oiled stands for operations per second I didn't message the number of read and write operations per second and it's a really important metric for applications which should performing quick transactions for think low-latency applications and transactional what clothes so think about reading and writing to a database and making multiple changes to the tasya and each of these changes can be sort of as a transaction so this is all about the ability to action reads and writes very quickly and if you do have an application like that and particularly if you have an application which requires greater than 16000 then you should definitely choose provisioned oils SSD as your volume per second where he's so think about complex queries a large amounts of data may be reporting applications long-running jobs involving large amounts of data maybe a business intelligence application comparing year-on-year financial performance that kind of thing so it's all about the ability to deal with large dataset and if you have an application with those kind of requirements and we have specific requirements around throughput and the number of bits read or written per second then throughput optimized HDD OST one that is the ones that he's so let's take a look at my Eczema tips for elastic Block store so just remember which you can attach it to an ec2 instance and there are a few different types of ailable starting off with gp2 which is a general-purpose SSD I miss is suitable for boot disk and general applications and it's capable of out to 16000 oil spill volume but if you need greater than a 16000 oils then you need to go for ir-1 which is provisioned oils SSD and this is suitable for online transaction processing and licensee sensitive applications you go up to $64,000 per volume and this is a high-performance option and it's also the most expensive and in addition to our one that is also a liar to which is the latest generation for Provisions oil it's also suitable for ltp and latency sensitive applications but the difference with this one is that you get a greater number of oil per gig so you get 500 oil stuck egg instead of the 50 that you get with other one it's up to 64,000 miles per volume and you also get the grace at your ability so is only other volume types it up to 99.9% durability but with ir to you get 5/9 of durability and then not going to text you on the percentage durability so you don't need to remember that but it's just good it's a very mind that I or II is the one to go for if you have some specific requirements around they touch your ability and the price for a lawyer to is the same as I owe one now in terms of the three put optimize options we got ST1 also known as throughput optimized HDD and this is suitable for Big Data Warehouse is an ETL the maximum throughput is measured in megabits per second per volume and the max is 500 megabytes per second per volume and it cannot be volume only the SSD options Sofia boot volume and then finally we've got the lowest cost option which is called HDD also known as SC1 which has a maximum throughput of 250 Megs per second Pavilion frequently accessed data and applications for which performance is not really an issue and you don't mind waiting a longer time for the results of your queries and once again it cannot be a boot volume and it is also the lowest cost so if you have an application which is caused sensitive but it's not particularly sensitive to Performance then this could be a good option and then those things I wanted to show you is this page in the documentation for EBS volumes and it's a link to this page in the resources that section of the course and if we scroll down we should find a table like that and it's table just compare all the different volume types in one easy place list the different characteristics and use cases for each different type of EBS volume so it got everything that out of clothes and I just wanted to show you that because it's just a different way of looking at the same information that we've been discussing in this picture so that is everything that you should need to know about the different types of EDS volume if you have any questions please let me know otherwise feel free to move on to the next lecture thank you
