okay helicopters and welcome to this lecture this lecture before we get started on Route 53 and creating our own domain name we are going to need to create an elastic load balancer is a pot of that and I just wanted to go through the theory of elastic load balancer is the what is an elastic load balancer what's a load balance so well the hinges in the name a load balancer simply helps us balance how load across multiple different servers I'm so let's say you've got a whole bunch of web service and you want to equally balanced the load between them you deploy load balancer and then using various types of Technology it will help you balance a load across different types type it into Google and click on the Wikipedia article it basically will go in and explain all the different layers of computing the application way balances can actually make very clever decisions they can actually go all the way down to the application layer and they can load balance based off that so they could if it could see that packets a destined for let's say sales. A cloud directly to the website or application so I'm it was a different subdomain could go to a completely different subdomain it can also look at whether or not someone's making a purchase maybe that would go to a whole bunch of different application so does my point being is that application load balances can see all the way up to the application layer and they can make very clever routing or rooting decisions based on that you know Information Network load balancer for this is where you basically want a soup of Boss performance and soup phosphate I'm it is basically a AWS is most expensive load balancer but it is what you would use in production especially if latency is an issue you want to use Network boy bounces when we have our plastic light balances and a classic light balances a pretty much that you know they don't recommend them anymore, but it is therefore Legacy purposes interesting lately developer associate exam actually test you mostly on classic low balances even though I hate themselves up pushing you to either use application load balances or network load balancer I'm so we will have a quick look at balances as well in the next lecture what we're going to go ahead and create is an application load balancer application load balancer let's say something let's say that you know we haven't application inside-out model X I'm we could send all that model X traffic to a specific set of you know web servers that are only designed for Mobile X and then if we had a Tesla Model S or we had a model 3 for example we could get our application load balance is to send them to completely different ec2 instances depending on the you know depending on the packets basically the application load balancer could be configured so I could figure out what type of car was being sending the requests and then it could send that to a group of web service that is designed specifically to respond to traffic for that car performance play 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds so think of Extreme Performance that is going to be one of those basically the fastest production car ever made I'm so operation operating at the connection level layout for Network load balance has a capable of handling millions of requests per second or maintaining ultra-low-latency she's so use a network load balancer for an Extreme Performance I would do better mind that he's going to be the most costly load balancer all of the three different low balances that's open to think of Extreme Performance three different types of load balancers you've got your application my balance is your network play balances and you'll classic light balances remember that a 504 error means that the Gateway has timed out and this means that the application is not responding within the idle timeout. So how do you do that what how do you troubleshoot this will go ahead and troubleshoot the application is the web server down or is the database service down do you need to scale out you need to scallop etcetera and if you need the ipv4 address of your end user using classic low balances then you just need to use the exported forehead up so that is low balances in a nutshell remember these tips going into your exam and you'll do fine in the next thank you
