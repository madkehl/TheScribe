if it's literally just about taking stress off your database because it's very very read heavy and you want elasticache and then again going into the exam just remember you want to use memcached day if abdication is your primary goal you want to keep things as simply as posted as simple as possible and you want to scale your cash horizontal scale out if you're doing leaderboards you want if you want date of assistance if you want more availability then you want redis but definitely if it talks about leaderboards rattus rattus rattus so that is it for this lecture guys if you have any questions please let me know if not feel free to move
