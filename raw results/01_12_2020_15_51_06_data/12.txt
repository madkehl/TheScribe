okay helicopters and welcome to this lecture this lecture we going to be looking at Amazon's relational database service and this is a lab what we going to do is we're going to provision a very simple a little RDS instance and then what we will do is we will go in and provisional web server we can use a bootstrap script so it would medically going to install things like Apache PHP of my SQL using that bootstrap script and then what we going to do is we are going to go in and basically configure a connection string a connection string is just a username and password and the address to connect to our IDs and Sons and full goes well we should be able to connect to console not you might as well get used to the new UI and here we can see out different options so it go to Aurora my sequel mariadb postgresql Oracle Microsoft SQL server and obviously make the default option Aurora cuz they're trying to push them and scroll down in here with database identifiers RDS instance inside AWS type in a cloud Guru and I'm going to copy that into my clipboard and I'm going to use that consistently across the difference you know credentials I'm so my mouse to use and I am going to say a cloud Guru Apostle at 8. You can actually order generate a password if you want as well you can actually use the command line using AWS Secrets manager to generate a really strong passwords as well that's just something that I used everyday things that you could go ahead and select down here we've got additional connectivity configuration I'm so cold out different subnet groups in here it's using the default one I'm you can also say whether or not you want this publicly accessible I'm going to say no PC security groups let's create a new Security Group we'll just call this IDs SG something like that and then we going to scroll down and availability is no preference configuration I'm just click in here and give the initial database name a cloud Guru depending on the size of the instance I can take up to 5 to 10 minutes to actually State instant if you click on your dashboard out sorry to click on instances you'll be able to see it so just click on idea how you can stay here that it is creating while we wait for that to create let's go back over to services and we'll go over to ec2 and hopefully a little and then an! and this is the path to our interpreter so this is what's going to interpret all the commands that we do after this line so one lime to a week. Yum install Apache we going to install PHP going to install PHP mysical when air force it to install it was there then going to update the operating system but they going to make sure Apache switches on the even if our ec2 instance restarts within going to start the Apache service so becomes a website to create a little PHP page which is just laying out phpinfo and then we're going to Output this child as index.php TMZ currently this just allows Port HTV and https over ipv4 and IPv6 go ahead and hit review and launch I don't even go ahead and launch my web server and I'm going to use my existing keypad which is cool mind you keep hair and I'm going to go ahead and launch that so that is now launching what I would do is probably just wait for 5 minutes and before we connect into this I'm you can however it while you're waiting just go over to your IDs incidents in here and we should hopefully have our IDs instance ready so quickly con instances here it is a cloud summary of all my instances and here is my case in point is a DNS address given an ipv4 address for your ipv4 address to this DNS address here I'm sorry I should be a little bit more specific when I say you never given a ipv4 I made a public ipv4 address for your endpoint so it could be that into a clipboard let's go back over to services and go over to ec2 you know that it's your bootstraps script has run and is ready I'm just by visiting the IP address should be copy this IP address and open up a new tab and hit enter that will show this page so we could all phpinfo page so website it is definitely up and running and ready to go all out scripts have finished installing when I ready to go in and can figure out connection strength you need to go over to terminal now and we will go in and configure the connection string so we can connect to our IDs instance play this out here and then I'm just going to go back over to the console and get my IDs and point K some back in the console just going to go out to services and go down to two IDs on the databases and a click in now and then I'm going to click on my instances a cloud Guru I'm going to scroll down and grab my instance endpoint which is this one here and copy that into my clipboard then now let's go back over to our time back in the time of the window to paste that in here yes how to get an error message is this to one last little thing that we need to do when we created out IDs instance we created a security group inside that object instance and this is a separate Security Group to what out ec2 instances in the right now we've got two different pieces of the AWS Cloud into different Security Group and the coast they won't be able to talk to each other by 2:40 so we will need to go out to the basically to the security group section and we're going to need to allow communication from One Security Group to another just going to wait for this to time out so you can see the error message so I'm just going to cause a video and if you are patient enough to wait here you go it says unable to connect to my sequels let's go have a look at it how we can fix this we just click back over to this tab so we could have Security Group in here and what we want to do is we wanted to go ahead and we want to go to inbound and we want I'm just going to remove this photo so we can see all out security groups I'm so what we want to do is we want to allow an inbound Security Group for 3306 I only wanted to allow this from a website so we're going to go and clicking here and we going to go down to my sequel which is Port 3306 I'll sing with Aurora and in here what we can do is if we actually start typing SG it will start to auto-populate and we want to whitelist Al webdmc so whichever security group that your web so that is in someone's ending in 0 6 7 and that is it going to go ahead and hit save so I can now see that rule down here we grow tobacco and if we hit refresh show me the next lecture thank you
