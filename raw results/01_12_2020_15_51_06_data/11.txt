database technology is fully compatible with my cycle so if you've got am I sick with a device you can ship it over to Aurora and we will cover Aurora in a lot more details as we carry through the course it's worth also mentioned a non-relational database is just so you know we're going to have a whole section on non-relational databases and in particular dynamodb we have documents and we have key value Pez so what's a collection will collection is basically a table think of it that way at document is simply a row in that table and the document comprises of a whole bunch of different key value has now the cool thing about non-relational databases is that you don't need to predefined the table structure so if you remember from the last one we had the idea the first name the surname in the agenda that will has to be prey to find before you can put data into it with number databases you don't need to pray to find your columns you can add them as you go let's have a look at it and examples so this is some Jason or no sequels we've got out ID without first name Elsa and I am outraged and we could our address and inside our address we've got a straight and I'll suburb so if we look at the idea to keep out of UK and it basically within Jason it always will start with this {and Then followed by quotation marks and then you'll have a field in there so that field is going to be essentially your column and then you're going to have a colon and then we're going to have more quotation marks and then the actual data itself so what is the ID set the apartment number etc etc. Don't worry too much about this just yet we will have a whole section of the Kohl's on Amazon's non-relational database of a flagship product which is dynamodb that is coming up another thing to mention around databases is what data warehousing is so date of warehousing is used for business intelligence and tools like cognos jaspersoft SQL Server sorry SQL Server reporting Services Oracle Hyperion and sap netweaver business intelligence tools and what they do is they are very large and complex data sets usually used by management to do queries on data such as current performance vs targets at cetera and you can actually build these databases specifically I'm so that they don't production databases but they're actually used for reporting only so you'll production database might push out all the information to a data warehouse and when you're running these really de Teran something much more complex perhaps you're trying to figure out the net profit for a Mia and Pacific for a digital radio product and she put Apple in large numbers of Records you've got to basically at out the number of radios sold in Europe Middle East and Africa so I'm Mia the number of radios sold in the Pacific and then you could have come up with the unit cost of the radios and HBO probably be different than the sales price of each radio and then basically have to figure out what the sales price is minus the unit cost and we also might have some kind of burn currency conversion as well so it's going to be doing an awful lot in one query data warehousing databases use different types of architecture bus from database perspective as well as also down to the physical infrastructure memory caching engines so it got memcached date with lettuce and we'll have to lecture comparing the two lights are on in the course I'm so that is really if this lecture let's just have a look at what we've learned so we've learnt that obvious is basically online transaction processing it consists of SQL my cycle postgresql Arco Aurora and Maria DB we got dynamodb which is Amazon's nosql offering and we're going to cover that off as a whole section in the course and then we've got a red shift which is Amazon's online analytics processing and this is used for business intelligence send a big data and then finally we have elasticache in memory caching and we have two engines inside web server can connect to that RDS server and read from it and then we're going to get a bit more Hands-On and start doing some more complicated stuff with IDs if you got the time please join me in the Netflix show thank you
