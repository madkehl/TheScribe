okay Pluto group welcome to this lecture it's like she was actually for Windows uses only I'm and we basically just going to teach you how to use putty and putty Cajun and you need need to use potty in order to SSH into your ec2 instance and you need putty Keygen in order to convert your pee and fog this is the key to a file that's a generated when you first create an ec2 instance create is generated in a medium format of a party doesn't support p.m. close the body needs its own pvk 500 into PC Capo Jen. Exe to the top and the bottom line I want you to know that it will finish downloading you might just want to copy this across to your desktop just because you will be using the deluxe route minimize everything and refresh my desktop that we go we can stay putty chapatis the ways the computer to computer icons this is what you going to use when your SSH thing and then puttygen is always of the key generator so it's not a computer the key icon and a launching ec2 instance the Amazon Linux I am I going to leave everything else as the folks I just want to show you how to connect into this instant instant and then go ahead and hit next tati Jen so the first thing we need to do is go to unload a l k so go ahead and hit Lord has a lot of people straight away cuz I can't see. Hey that's cuz it's looking for a p p k file on but we saved as a p.m. Pho what we want to do is just hit all falls down here and then open up my puppy. P.m. and then we got it says it successfully imported it to use this came with the Posse you need to use the save Private key command to save it and put his arm format so we're going to go ahead and do that if you want to protect us what you can do is just basically impossible if you need a password in order to click on here so maintains the same file name instead of serving as a dog PDF p.m. I'm going to save it as adults APK go ahead and hit save and that is literally it now if we go into I download directory we can see p.m. file and we can see if we need to do is open up potty and so it is puppy it's a very simple interface to use I'm going to go ahead and go and look at my ec2 instances and hopefully it is live now and I will be able to get my IP address so yet. It is and there's my IP address down here I'm going to highlight the IP address and I'm going to right click and consideration we can type in here ec2 - user and then at and then the party of the IP address 5251 that 120 70 now what I can do is with the copy and paste it in save sessions one of them say that just yet the last thing we want to do is go over here going to go into SSH and in here we going to until we're out private key is so this is the one that we just generated my puppy keto K open it up and now we we got it all the way back up to the top two session we can hit save we don't need to do this again we can basically just go in here and then hit that first thing is going to ask you about the service in the registry I can take just a little bit of time but it's just cleaning up now it's done all the installations and once this is done what we need to do is we going to go in and install Apache & Apache just tens this little survey into a web server and then what we'll do is we'll create a little web page just that says Hillary klug yours or something like that that's not finish updating let's clear the screen and to install Apache we just need to write yum install than hate tdd and then wife has now installed and again I'm going to clear the screen started the one thing that we want to do is if this ec2 instance reboots we want Apache to come back on automatically so to do that we just type in chickncone fig than HTTP day and then we stay on and that will just means that if we restart this ec2 instance of hat she will come on automatically so we can now typing service HT DVD and then status that will show us if the Hasty DVD service is running the Apache service it is now running and when we instill that we've created the directory so if we go to CD dub dub dub HTML this is the root directory of a web server we type in LS we can see that there's nothing there so let's go ahead and fix that what I'm going to do is I'm going to write index. HTML and we're going to create a little web page H1 Sahara and then it's just going to say hello Cloud gurus in and out H1 again end out buddy this is like literally the most simple piece of Education you know you can do it and we're going to end HTML and HTML5 then I'm just going to hit the control X us if we want to stay there going to hit yes and then I'm going to hit enter and so now if I do LS we can see my little index. HTML the next thing to do is just going to clear the screen let's go web browser and see this website to this ec2 instance now before we go on to registering a domain name we need to Wigan the need to create a application load balancer in order for all this to work let's go in the next lecture in Explorer from a theoretical point of view what are the different types of load balancers eye what's available to you and then once we've done that will go on and will register domain name and will point out of my name to our application load balancer which will then pointed out ec2 instance and then you'll be able to visit this website just by typing in a domain name such a time please join me in the next election thank you
