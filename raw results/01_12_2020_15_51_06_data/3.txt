hello stalkers and welcome to this lecture where we going to take a look at all the different ec2 instance types of edible and that all loads of them but don't worry any of the associate level exams you don't need to memorize them all and it's only for the solutions architect professional where they do expect you to know the different instance types and the differences between them so that being said let's take a look at the difference ec2 instance types available so what do we mean when we talk about instance types well this is all about the underlying Hardware that is used to host your ec2 instance so when you don't send instance the instance type determines the hardware of the underlined host computer used fuel instance or where your instance is running so ultimately RNC fazo virtual machines running on a physical server and it this physical server that I'm talking about so the hardware characteristics of the underlined physical server now instant type also determines other characteristics or capabilities like CPU memory and storage each instance type of his different compute memory and storage capabilities and depending on these capabilities they are grouped together in instant families so how do you know which one to choose well as simple answer is to select an instance type based on your application requirements so you select an instance type based on the requirements of the application that you planets around on your instance so there is a massive choice and it is growing steadily as I bring out more and more instance types and the reason they have so many is because instance types of optimized to fit different use cases and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications but the best way to understand instance types is to take a look at the console and I'm going to show you exactly what I mean so here I am in the AWS console and I'm going to select easy to scroll down to launch instance select the Amazon Linux 2 mi and this is where we select the instant type so you'll see that they are absolutely loads of different instance types and I are all grouped together in families so you can filter by the different family name so we call the micro instances for the very small instance types weak Channel purpose computer optimized and then hardware-accelerated instance types which includes things like field programmable gate array Graphics processing units machine learning and memory and storage optimized and we going to take a look at each of these families and turn so let's take a look at general-purpose to begin with and if we hover over the family name it will give us a bit of a description so general-purpose provides a balance of computer memory and network it's a good choice for many applications recommended for small or medium databases by conservatives will sap SharePoint and other Enterprise applications so that is a general purpose and if we took it the next heading on to type this is the instance name so whenever you hit anything like T2 micro T3 or M5 Etc these all the instants names and every different type of instant has its own unique name and when you see a number off to the letter that indicates the generation number so the t2 micro is the second generation then moving across the table you can take a look at the specification of the instant type so how many virtual CPUs how much memory the type of storage I will find out about CBS or elastic block storage lights on in the course and it also gives you an idea of network performance as well so that is a general-purpose we both are gold micro instances and these are eligible for the AWS free tier for the first 12 months you'll get 750 hours of micro instances so these are really great if you're just going to cost you anything up to 700 the hours in your first 12 months and he's my coincidences everyday a low-cost option and then most suited for low throughput applications like low-traffic website or very small applications because I've only got one of actual CPU less than a gig of memory and in terms of network performance it's very low but you wouldn't want to run the Ohio traffic a website on one of these so moving on to compute optimized and I've got some great out here and the reason for that is the architecture of the selected am I is not supported by this instance type that pretty interesting so this instance type it basically doesn't support the operating system that I selected in the beginning so if I scroll down and what did I say about compute optimized of CPU to memory used to use field programmable gate arrays for accelerating some of the algorithmic trading so that's real low latency trading and it's a highly competitive business so any competitive advantage that you can gain by processing you'll algorism and running your analytics a few seconds faster than your competitor can give you a massive advantage in the market for all of these instant types begin with the letter F and at the time of recording these are all showing as F-14 these are the first generation but they are adding more and more all the time moving on it to GPU and CPU stands for graphics Processing Unit so he's obviously a grateful Graphics but I also widely used for applications which need parallel processing so that could be Graphics it could also be high power Computing image rendering and media processing applications I & H as well let's see what they say about storage ultimeyes instances so provides you with direct attached storage options for applications with specific discount storage capacity requirements and the other three instances are suitable for nosql databases which benefit from hitron de mayo and the D two instances off a running large-scale Data Warehouse on all the different instant families but don't worry as I said before you don't need to remember the mole just have a general awareness so I'm moving on to my exam tips for ec2 instance types just remember the instance type determines the hardware configuration and capabilities of the host computer for your instant or virtual machine is running each instance type of his different compute memory storage capabilities and their group together in instance families and you should select an instance type which is most appropriate based on the requirements of your application so that is the end of this lecture if you have any questions please let me know otherwise feel free to join me in the next lecture when we going to get our hands dirty no touching an ec2 instance
