okay helicopters and welcome to this lecture in sexual going to look at the CLI all the command line interface we're going to interact with AWS using the CLI inside-out ec2 instance that we created earliest you going to need to log into your ec2 instance and I'm going to click on all I want to get is my public IP address cuz I remember it's just going to copy this into my clipboard then I'm going to open up terminal and connect to this ec2 instance to here I am and then I'm going to go ahead and command line so whenever you using the command line you always start with AWS and then you start with a service that you wanted to use so let's try AWS S3 I'm going to say LS we want to list everything and now is three buckets out straight away it says unable to locate credentials you can configure credentials by running AWS config up so we run AWS configure it's going to ask us for an access key ID and secret access key and an order to generate these we need to go back to the AWS console some back in the inside here what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create a new user basically generating an access key ID and secret access key allies in sdks another development tools Now using if I don't click this button here they won't be able to login to the Management console which is what I'm currently logged into right now and I'm going to just leave it at programmatic access I'm going to go ahead and hit next to add my permission now and here it says set permissions for developing so you can add a user to a group that's probably the best thing that we want to do is we want to create a group or I'll developers so it's cold this out Development Group so developers and we need to then give them a policy now in here administrator access is basically god mode so it gives you full access to 8 that because they could go in and start doing anything inside the AWS console Source really downhill company policy Soma create this group and that's creative my group called developers and then I'm going to add a user to this group so I had to use it to this group will I can be a little bit tricky if you just scroll down you'll sit down his hit next review and so we can review with credit at 1 is users soon as I finish recording this video is sorry that you won't be able to log in and start mining Bitcoin using my credentials I'm surprised that in here default region this is the default region in which this user creates was EU West one and then I decided to make an S3 bucket that bucket button specifier region will exist within tus1 and if you just leave this blank I believe it is a beautiful region is Northern Virginia so what I'm going to do is just leave it blank and hit enter and devote output format again I'm just going to hit enter and leave that as blank so what I'm going to do now let's not play this game let's try a tab S3 S3 bucket so why don't we go ahead and create it just going to go over and fix that so rather than that we go. Loaded to out S3 bucket we can actually say that by typing AWS S3 and then LS and then estres the name of that bucket a cloud Guru 1 2 3 4 - okay that will basically list everything inside the bucket let's go over and just have a quick look at this a text file in the AWS console some back in the AWS console I've come out of that I am screen and the one thing to note that when you do generate an access key ID and secret exit skate you will only be able to see it once once if we go back in to I am weak and develop who won security credentials remind join the others see at once so you might want to save it somewhere very very safe Ian the next Bachelor look at why you want to save that somewhere very very safe something I am quickly going to do is going to make this inactive so that is now inactive what I can now do is I can delete it by clicking the little X go ahead and hit too late now that this particular user has no longer has access key ID of secret access key you can recreate it will generate it again and again and we ever see this one's quick on S3 so should be able to see it here it is in here I Calgary 1234 arcade note that the region is u.s. East one source of Northern Virginia and if we click in him will be able to see a little txt file I we haven't made this Publix let's just make it public now and click in it except here it says he'll be a little bit hard to stay alive. HTML or just type in AWS CLI commands in command and you can go through and have a look at all the available commands in here and different examples of how to use them expected to understand the command line in any sort of very deep level I going into your exam but you should definitely know the basic commensurately around S3 especially if you are going to work with AWS regulate so what am I exam tips okay so what am I exam tips will let start with least privilege you should always give your uses the minimum amount of access required to develop his might not need admin access they might just need admin access. sorry I bet I wouldn't mind seeing the next lecture what we're going to look at is we going to look at how not to use exterior access KNX sk-ii I'm actually going to look at how we can use rolled we have gone into that little ec2 instance and we did teminite. K-paz that keep hair is no longer valid I can no longer access the sale or I can no longer use the CLI I'm so in the next but you're welcome to look at his role so if you got the time please join me in the Netflix show thank you
