helicopters and welcome to this lecture now the key to learning AWS is getting as much Hands-On practical experience as possible and in this lecture we going to get our hands dirty and launch an ec2 instance and then configure it as a web server so if you'd like to join me in the console will get started now you can complete this lecture using your own AWS free tier account or if you have access to Cloud playground then you can just say Alexa, play ground and select AWS signed books and you will be provided with your own login to an AWS account that we provide so you can just select open sandbox right click and I'm going to open a new incognito window and then you just copy and paste this username and password into the aw console sewing in and you should be good to go but if you don't have access to sign book start with why you can just do everything within your own it free to account so from the AWS console the first thing I'm going to do is make sure that I'm in the North Virginia region so this is the main region with AWS release all venue services so if you want to play with the latest services this is the region to select so we are going to settle an ec2 instance and configure it as a web server so I want you to head to services and we'll find ec2 on the computer social sec to scroll down until we see each instance and select Norwich instance and instances are created using Amazon machine images or am eyes and this is basically the operating system start Windows Red Heart Amazon Linux Etc to choose from and they even have some which have been optimized for a specific workload for example we got some down here which have been optimized for deep learning workload and these images will come pre-configured with some of the packages and software that you might need for machine learning so it comes with a lot of these utilities and libraries already installed but in this course when my knee going to be using the Amazon Linux am I so we'll select the latest one out of the moment that's so you still like that one and this is where we select or instance type so we can select an instance type based on the requirements of our application and this is just going to be a little web server so we going to keep to the default which is at a to micro so hit next and hit we can set the number of inches 5 minutes it's going to collect the monitoring metrics on your system and that is what you get for free but if you want more detailed monitoring you can collect the data at 1 minute intervals instead but I do charge you extra for it in terms of tenancy we're going to stick to the shed Tennessee model and then if you scroll down to the bottom of the page you'll find Advanced details and hitting his text books under use it later this is why you can bootstrap scripts and a bootstrap scripts is basically any commands that you want to run when the system first boots up you can add it here as a bootstrap script for example you could want to come onto to update your operating system with the latest packages or you could install an application and it is something that we could cover laser on in the course so if you're happy with that will hit next and this is why we can add All Storage default they give us a single EBS volume on this is all root volume also known as a boot disk and this is what a Linux operating system is going to be installed so far is going to be general purpose FSA I'm not going to be fine for the majority of applications but if you do have a high performance or low latency application that you can select the provision Doyle's SSD or oil one now they're also showing another option which we haven't covered and this is really a legacy option so this is the previous generation and the current recommendation is to go with a general-purpose gp24 most applications and then use provision Doyle's oil one for high-performance applications which need additional oils on the right hand side you can also encrypt your volume so if we select the drop-down but these are completely user-defined Kate value Pez which are associated with your instance I know a really good way to organize your AC two instances so you might want to use a tag 290 system or describe which team it belongs to or which application is running throwing a tag name and I'm going to call my instant my web server to hit next and now it's a Security Group Inc Office security group of similar to a virtual firewall so this is what we use to allow traffic in an ounce of on instance and they give us on 22 so this gives remote login using SSH and if you haven't used as a face before it's really similar to RDP so it's basic what we use to log in and have a command line session to all Linux server but in addition to SSH we're also going to need to configure under the rule for festival I'm going to change the name of my security group so that I know it's cold so I'm going to call at my web Dan's e Admiral and so I select HTTP and it should say Port 80 and the source is going to be anywhere because this is going to be a web server so we'll need to allow access from anywhere on this is the notation that we used to define that so it's 0.02 or IP addresses so that means any IP address is going to be able to connect to an instance on Port 80 what is ipv4 notation I miss is the IPv6 notation for the same thing and then in terms of the SSH rule well we can set that to any way or we can set it to my own IP address as well I'm from now we're just going to keep it to anywhere but if this was your production system you will absolutely not going to want to use that kind of a rule you want to look it down to a specific IP address so you might want to select my IP select a custom I pay but for now we're just going to keep that to anywhere for now that hid review and lunch and lunch and now it's asking us about Kitty Pez or to connect using SSH we need to create a public and private keeper and this will allow us to log into an instance so let's create a new one and I'm going to call it might new keypad and hit download and this is going to download it to on local machine consists of a public key and a private cake and it's used to control or restrict who can log-in it to the server and basically anyone with the private key is going to be able to login and if you don't have the private key then you're not going to be able to login so you want to be careful who you share this private key with and you also it wants to make sure that you don't accidentally delete it and that you store it in a secure and accessible location so once you've downloaded your keypad and it should end up in your local it downloads directory then you can just click no chances for instance has been initiated and this is showing on instant ID so if we just click on the instance of a date that will take us to the ACT he is on ec2 instance and hopefully it should be showing as green and running and if we look down here here is a public IP address so now the next thing we're going to do is connect it to your instance using this public IP address now if you're working on a Mac you can follow along with me but if your local machine that you're working on is a Windows machine then you'll have a slightly different process for logging in so if you are working on a Windows machine then please stop this video now and go to the very next video in the course which is going to show you how to login using a Windows machine and using a toll that you can download called potty but if you are my accuser like me then you can just follow along and do exactly what I do so here I am in my applications folder on my Mac and I'm going to head to utilities and I'm going to open a terminal and the first thing I'm going to do is change to my downloads directory I'm going to check that my private key has downloaded and there it is and the next thing we need to do is we need to set the permissions so I'm just going to run CH mode full series Arrow and then the name of my private key so that just sets the permissions on this file and if you forget to do this it will not work and now we are ready to SSH on ec2 instance so just type SSH easy to use a that we need to grab the public IP address of our intestines so come back to the console and grab your public IP and paste and then one as I followed by the name of all private key and hit enter now it's all things we want to continue just type yes and if it's what you should see something like this so we've established an SSH connection over Port 22 to ec2 instance I'm just going to clear the screen I'm then going to elevate my privileges so it's hard to sudo Su so I'm now effectively the root user and I now have full admin access on this instance so now the next thing we're going to do is turn all this into a web server so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to upgrade our operating system to all the latest packages and to do that we just typed yum update - 184 yes and hit enter and it's just outside all the latest packages and the colonel as well so this just means we're up to date with any security features and Colonel packages and now we are ready to install the Apache website so I'm just going to type yum install httpd for yes and then to start Apache it's systemctl stolte httpd so this. So web server but if we want it to start automatically at boot time we can run it systemctl enable httpd so whenever this instance boots or when it reboots it's going to stall httpd at boot time so it's going to stall to automatically stasis httpd if it's all running correctly than it should show as active and it's been running for a couple of minutes so now the next thing we're going to do is we going to create and default web page so I'm going to change the rectory to ball up HTML5 Ellis so there's no web pages in here yet and this is just a default directory structure that gets installed when you install the web server so let's out of first web page and I'm just going to use the basic text editor included on ec2 instance and it's cold so I'm going to type and if you've never used it might be so it will just go ahead and create our little in Dexter HTML file so I'm just going to write the most basic possible HTML file so we thought office HTML section httpd service is running an ulcer make sure that the security group allows access for anyone on Port 80 so there we go we have created an ec2 instance we've installed the Apache web server and we've created a simple website that we can access over the internet using the public IP address so that is the end of this lecture and if you created this in your own account then do remember to go in and terminate no instance as soon as you finished to avoid any unnecessary charges and you can just head to the ec2 dashboard select your instance and then on the actions and instant State you can select terminate for hopefully order that work for you and if you have any questions please let me know otherwise I feel free to move on to the next lecture thank you
