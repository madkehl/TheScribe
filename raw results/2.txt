hello stalkers and welcome to this lecture where we going to explore the various pricing options or pricing models for AC to so let's take a look now there are a few different pricing models with ec2 so that start with on demand which is the default so we don't demand you paid by the hour or the second depending on the type of instance you're running so you only pay for the time when you are running your instance we didn't have reserved instances and we've reserved instances you can reserve a C2 capacity for either 1 or 3 is so you commit to using a certain amount of ec2 instances of a specific type of either one or three years and in return for making this commitment you get up to a 72% discount on the hourly charge and reserved instances operate Regional level so say for example you commit to using at 10 instances of type T3 Lodge in the US East one region if you spin up up to 10 instances within the US East one that will be covered by your reserved capacity but if you don't turn in Cincinnati different region that's not going to be covered by your reservation so you won't get the discount on instances you spin up outside the region or fuel Reserve capacity we didn't have spot instances and this is where you can purchase unused capacity at a massive discount of up to 90% and the price fluctuates according to supply and demand so you set a maximum price that you're willing to pay for the instance but the catch is that as soon as the price exceeds your maximum the instance will be terminated or hibernated depending on the options that you've chosen so you got a massive discount but it's not really very first time on demand is the most flexible option moving onto reserved instances so these are great for applications with predictable usage Parsons applications with a steady-state very predictable usage that also really good for applications which have very specific capacity requirements and he wants to be sure that the capacity is always going to be available in the region that you want when you need it reserved instances are also really good if you can pay upfront and if you make up front payment with your reserved instances then you can get the benefit of even more discounts and there are three types of reserved instance or Festival we got the standard reserved instance where you can reserve a set quantity of a sudden instance type and they claim you can get up to a 72% discount but in practice I've never been able to get it anywhere near that much and I think it all depends on the chin of components and options you put insta pricing calculator and how much you're willing to pay upfront with started reserved instances is that if you reserve say10 Tea Tree Lodge instances for 1 year and then your application requirements change you may need to change to a bigger instance but with studded reserved instances you cannot change your mind so that is where convertible reserved instances coming home with these you get up to 54% of the undermount price and the great thing with these is that you get the option to change to a different reserved instance type of equal or greater value so if we want to move our application from T3 Lodge to T3 extra large we can convert all reservation to any other instance type of equal or greater value and don't worry too much of the Moon about these instance types and instance names we going to go through all of the different incidents types in the next lecture and lovely we have scheduled reserved instances so these allow you to launch a reserved instance within a timeframe that you specify and this allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule which only requires are either a fraction of a day week or month so this allows you to schedule your reservation for window of time which suits you so think about maybe a phone company calculating customer bills at the end of each month so they might want to use it scheduled reserved instances because I know that always going to use a fairly predictable not amount of capacity for a few days at the end of every single month and they can use scheduled reserved instances to save some money on that AWS bill want to spot instances in which sport instances if you remember you set a maximum price that you're willing to pay for the instance and then the actual price fluctuates with supply and demand and if the price exceed your maximum Daniel instant can either be terminated or hibernated depending on the options that you selected so when would we use a sport instanceof well they're really great for applications which have a flexible start and end time they also what really well for applications that are really only feasible at very low computer prices so you can take advantage of the low cost of a spot instances and that also suitable for applications or uses with an urgent need for large amount of additional Computing capacity which is temporary so it's not an ongoing requirements it's just for a specific job or workload so you might use a spot instances for what clothes like drink or parallel work clothes like genomic sequencing or even running a calculations for algorithmic trading engines and then finally dedicated hosts so when would we use these will these are really great for meeting compliance requirements or regulatory requirements which may not support a multi-tenant architecture that was so great if you're in a situation where you've got so far licensing which doesn't support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments and you can purchase them on either an on-demand or reserved basis and we don't demand that purchase hourly and with the reserved option you can get up to a 70% discount of the on demand price now in addition to these pricing options they've also introduces something cold savings plans which is another way to save money on your AWS door so you can save up to 72% on All AWS add explosive is the AWS services in particularly around AC to under various different pricing models so here is the pricing calculator and included a link to this in the resources section of the course so you just had to create estimate and you can select a service or you can search for it so I'm just going to search for easy to hit configure and this is where you can create the cost estimate for ec2 instances for festival make sure your region is correct scroll down and then you can select the specification of your ec2 instance and you can select the capacity ones either in terms of CPUs or memory or you can search for instances boy name and hit our all our instance types so I'm going to go in and select T3 medium I'm going to have a quantity of ten and this is why you can choose the pricing so let's start off with on demand instances and if we scroll down the page all total monthly cost for 10 service is going to be $333 so what happens if I change that to standard reserved instances I'm going to reserve for one year with no upfront payments and straightaway my cost has reduced to 220 so what if I make my reservation at 3 is the different pricing options saving approaches all wonderful one of the best ways to control costs in AWS is to remember to turn off the things that you no longer need so don't leave Services running if you do I need them anymore and I love this cotton it's a good reminder to us all to remember to terminate instances if we no longer using them and especially if you're working in your own AWS accounts it's really good practice to decommission everything as soon as you've finished playing with it to avoid any unnecessary costs but let's move on to my exam tips for ec2 pricing options so there's on demand which allows you to pay by the hour or second depending on the type of instance you run and this is a great option for flexibility a discount about to 90% prices fluctuate with supply and demand and you set your maximum that you're willing to pay and if the price goes over the maximum they going to eat a hibernate or terminate your instance depending on the options that you selected and it is great for applications with flexible start and end times but it's not so great for applications with need to be up and running all the time and then finally that is the dedicated option and this is what you get a physical easy to see if you have compliance requirements which are preventing you from using a multi-tenancy option so that is the end of this Alexa if you have any questions please do let me know otherwise please join me in the next lecture where we going to take a look at all the different ec2 instance types that are available and that all loads of them so I'll see you in the next lecture thank you
