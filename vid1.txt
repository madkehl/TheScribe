hi everybody can you hear me I'm hoping that everybody can hear me I'm going to start over to cuz we just had some new people join my name is Tracy King and welcome to today's orientation webinar so hopefully everyone can hear if you can't please chat me in the chat box today's webinar is being recorded and will be provided to you in a follow-up email additionally we can provide you with a copy of the slide Duck Pond request if you email the NBA help desk if you have any questions can e-mail or help desk with the questions and we will answer them at a follow-up email as well or help desk phone number and the e-mail address will be provided to you at the end of the webinar the goal of today's webinar is to emphasize the planning early for data-sharing will make it much easier at submission time we hope to show you the NDA tools and resources that are available to you and offer you some helpful tips along the way today is webinar is the first in the series of webinars as mentioned is primarily aimed at principal investigators how whether however other staff are welcome and encouraged to attend this training focuses on the first tasks that are expected to be completed early after Grant award II webinar is about data harmonization it's aimed at staff members who will be working to format and submit the actual data this training dives into the meat of the NDA data dictionary attending data harmonization training early on excuse me I will teach you how to format the data we urge you to take advantage of the already Define data structures in the NBA did the dictionary that can be used right away to create a method for data curation using the data dictionary has the added benefit of already being formatted for data submission to NDA webinar instruction how to validate and submit data this webinar overlaps where the data harmonization webinar left off and is offered around the to submission Cycles this webinar helps prepare users to understand the process of validation error handling submission and post submission quality assurance and Quality Control Data access is Arlo Austin the series it discusses the process of requesting data access and covers the various methods to query package data and get data from NBA Live recordings of any of our previous webinars if you email her help desk we hope that you walk away with an understanding of the next steps and know what you need to do to contact us throughout the data submission process if you need any assistance let's give a little bit of background about the NIMH data archive or NDA as we call it and DEA is more than a database it's a platform that supports the sharing of human subjects data house. NIMH and I actually started as the National Database for autism research or end are in 2006 and originally focused autism related data collected through grants funded by several NIH institutes in 2014 NIMH further supported the importance of data sharing and expanded this expectation to most human subjects grants that it funded and hiei continues to expand today as you explore the NDA website you will see references to each of the separate repository shown on this slide currently qualified users can request access to one or more of the repositories before we jump in I wanted to show you one slide that visualizes the entire data submission and sharing process as we go along will show the slide again to show the webinar progress don't worry not all of the steps will be covered in detail during this presentation we are only going to about halfway up to about the red line in detail the good news is that you've already completed two of the steps prior to Ward so you may already be familiar with the data sharing language and expectations so now we're going to pick up on activities that occur at the time of Grant award here is how to find the data sharing terms and conditions becoming familiar with the terms and conditions should be one of the early steps after Grant award I encourage you to view these terms as soon as possible so that you know the expectations and you reduce any misunderstandings to now that we've gotten through the grant Awards segment is me remember to refer to the NDA sharing terms and conditions frequently it will be one of your biggest resources now we're going to move into the post-awards segment you most likely already received the initial welcome email this e-mail prompts you to complete the NDA data submission agreement or DSA and took to create an NDA user account NDA will communicate with you throughout the entire Grant cycle to keep you on track and to provide you with helpful information to do this we send a series of automatically generated emails a couple of tips the emails we send our from the NIMH data archive address you should add our email address to your safe senders list so that you don't miss any important correspondence as always feel free to contact the NBA help desk if you have any questions or need more information the date of submission agreement or DSA is a policy document that is required prior to being allowed to submit any data if you haven't done this yet you should do it now it doesn't take long to fill out and is an easy task to complete plus it is defined as an expectation on the NDA sharing terms and conditions and it can hold up your project later with the Eds a tool you can populate review and submit the NDA data submission agreement the agreement must be signed by the principal investigator and an authorized institutional business official principal investigators on NIH grants with NDA sharing expectations are expected to complete the DSA within six months of initial award the sooner the better login with your era Commons username and password to begin once you've completed the data submission agreement you will select a signing official at your institution who will sign off on the document electron if you are not sure who at your institution is appropriate for you to send the data submission agreement for approval the NDA helpdesk an email a list of your institution signing officials to contact the NDA help desk email NDA help at mail.nc.gov with any questions or concerns now you can check the DSA off your list so you can see we're moving along and now we're going to move on to the NDA collection once your receipt once we received at DSA from you the pi is granted ownership of their NDA collection and a second automated email is sent this email covers the next steps in the process and includes the direct URL to your NDA collection you should note your NDA collection number which is a four digit number it will come in handy if you contact the EA help desk those of you who have not worked with NDA before probably wondering what an NDA collection is a collection is a virtual container for data and other information related specifically to your project grant information is also contained in the collection a collection is created for you by the ndi staff to get to your collection you can use the direct URL that we emailed to you or you can take the following steps first login to the NDA website click on my dashboard at the top right of your screen from there you will click login enter your username and password and you'll be on your profile page with your NDA collection in the right-hand side menu so now let's get familiar with a collection here example of a newly-created collection there are several tabs at the top but we're only going to be concerned with three at this point the general tab the data expected tab in the permissions tab on the general tab you will find information related specifically to your project if their project is associated with an nih-funded Grant than the grant number will be provided collection owners and administrators can modify any of the items that are within a frame on this page a quick tip when you make changes don't forget to click save in order to assign collection privileges to your staff you need to login yourself to add another user to your collection such as a data manager or other staff members you need to know their username or the email address associated with their NDA user account if they haven't already set up an account they need do this first once you click the add user button or green message will appear at the top to indicate that the user has been added and their information will appear in the section below there are three types of privileges that you can assign to a user submission allows for uploading data query gives read-only Privileges and admin is both submission and quiri privilege plus the ability to give others privileges so that they can set up date expected for example a data manager or somebody who's working with the data again be sure to click save after giving permissions or the user's won't be saved giving permissions to others may turn into a recurring task throughout the grant cycle as staff come on board or transition out you want to make sure that appropriate users are added if staff members leave please let us know we can deactivate their NDA user account a couple of tips here first as I mentioned we send out automated emails the default is to send these to NDA collection owner which is usually the pi but it may be more appropriate for another person on your staff to receive the email notifications instead alternate Lee you may want others to receive the emails in addition to the NDA collection owner the settings can also be changed within the permission stop for now we're going to move away from the NDA collection but we will return to talk about it at the date expected list now we're going to talk about your consent plan as it is still early afterward you will likely be working on your protocol and consent documents to submit to the IRB Grant recipients must include language in the informed consent form agreeing that date and supporting documentation submitted to NDA may be accessed and used broadly by approved users for research sample consent language is available on our website to help researchers but it's important to note that it is outside the purview of NDA staff to review informed consent documents related to consent is the good the global unique identifier or goo it is an ID number that is required for each subject while they do it is based on personally identifiable information or pii that TI is never transmitted to NDA in fact it never leaves your site to create a good you will need to ask the subject for their name date of birth sex at 1st and city of birth this information is found on a birth certificate you should ask for their given name instead of a nickname so for example Jonathan versus Johnny think about how you will build this into your processes ahead of time so that you get what you need the first time and you don't have to recontact subjects also any staff members who will be involved in creating Goods will need to have permission to access the good tool and you'll need to Grant the permission in your NDA collection to obtain good Total Access contact the NDA help desk to request to request access to the good tool access to create Goods requires that you have an NDA submission permissions on an NDA collection if you don't submit data 2nda than permission is granted on a special Case by case basis if unsure please contact the help desk so look for moving long and on their progress and now it's time to focus our attention back to the NDA collection I just want to point out the tasks that we've completed so far and the next task don't necessarily need to be completed in sequential order you or designated members of your staff can and should perform these tasks simultaneously a moment ago we looked at the collection and pointed to the three tabs that require your immediate attention immediate attention so far we've covered the general tab in the permissions tab now we're going to look at the data expected tab the date expected is the primary tracking mechanism for your data submission project and you or a member of your staff can set it up in your NDA collection this slide summarizes the purpose and other key elements of this feature simply put it is just a list of all the data that you are collecting with the associated subject counts and initial submission and sharing dates for each item the initial submission a chair dates you said or based on the standard NDA sharing terms when the nd8 collection is created the date expected list is seeded with a research subject and pedigree item with a default initial submission date based on your start date this is a summary structure expected from all projects not only does this list once completed provide a common understanding of what is to be submitted and when but it also allows for flexibility in the event that your projects timeframe changes many people put out creating the date expected list for fear that it will change don't worry if things change you can change the date expected listed anytime when creating your data expect unless you should refer to the NDA data standards page on the NDA website for using existing assessments submitting new assessment and instructions on how to submit all kinds of data when you first get your collection created the date expected list will look like this as mention NDA staff seed each collection with a single record the research subject data structure for genomics and subject data for structure for omix project is expected of all newly awarded grants to provide basic information about the subjects such as demographics pedigree links family goo Ed's diagnosis phenotype and Sample location that are critical to allow for easier queering of shared data when Grant recipients update the data definition data expected definition they are expected to update the subject count submit date and share date for this project item also if someone like your program officer Where to view the date expected Tab and see only one data item listed they would know that your data expected list had not yet been completed let's look in an example of a newly of a completed data expected list as we mentioned it's ultimately just a list of items that you're collecting and the expected enrollment numbers with initial dates for both submission and sharing will be going over how to actually use your account to set this up in Greater detail in our next webinar on data harmonization but for now we're going to go over briefly so you have an idea of what the process looks like when when we say you are adding items to the list these items are tied to one or more specific data structures in the NDA data dictionary the NDA data-sharing terms and conditions ND ND a data dictionary will be the most helpful resources to you as you complete your data expected list as you'll see on the next slide to get started adding these items to the list you will click on the green new data expected button then you will see this dialogue for adding an item if your data is already Associated structure in the data dictionary you'll be able to find it and add it to the list using the default options to buy data structure title is shown here in this example I want to add the skid 5 for anxiety disorders and I know that it's already been defined in the data dictionary so I'm going to use the search by data structure title option I'll start to type in the data structure search and see that it appears in the NBA date addiction I see several options for skid of here but I want to select the one for anxiety disorders I can enter my targeted enrollment let's say 600 subject and set the dates based on the definitions in the NDA data-sharing terms and conditions I mentioned earlier and I set the dates based on that determination and the appropriate time frame for my project now in this case finding the data item I needed was easy but what if I'm planning to use a questionnaire and I can't find it in the data dictionary in this case you want to choose upload definition option sorry about that see if the site will go you will still need to define the targeted enrollment as well as the initial submission and initial share dates you will then provide a title for the measuring upload the file this could be electronic definition if you created one in any case you will want to provide the actual measure and any instructions and scoring algorithms that can help our data definition teamwork on a structure for you if you have more than one file to upload you can zip them and upload it the zip file we just want to point this out because how to get a new data structure created is a relatively common question and this is the process to do that added to your date expected list once all the items have been added you'll have a completed list as we showed earlier and you'll be able to come in and update the dates are counts as the project proceeds if changes are needed to keep it up to date for our purposes today this brief overview of what the process looks like should be helpful but we'll be covering it in more detail in a later session so we recommend that he ever is going to be completing the data expected list attend our next webinar or view this recording or or one of the other recordings this lie just show some summary information on the data expected list so we've completed all of the steps as part of the initial setup of your data sharing process and project we encourage you and your staff to register for a next webinar in the series data harmonization as well as to provide more detail and instructional material on how to complete the data expected and additional tasks associated with preparing for submission as mentioned all of our upcoming webinars and tutorials can be found on our website or you can request a copy of any of the previously recorded webinars through the help desk and we can send you were the recording since we'd like to emphasize that your data needs harmonize to ours will also briefly outline the next phases of the process the first is the NDA data dictionary well this will be covered in Greater detail than the harmonization training as well it's worth taking a look at the data dictionary is a collection of all measures and instruments assessment and assessments currently harmonized in NDA through the definition of a standard data structure see the full data dictionary for a list of these definitions and click on one to enter its individual structure page and visit to find elements these can be reference when formatting your data collection you're going to see how to how to get to the data dictionary now data cannot be uploaded until corresponding data structure until a corresponding data structure is defined in the data dictionary this just an example of what the data dictionary looks like you can locate it many different ways from our home page and from some of our drop-down menus now we'll take a talk a little bit about the standard process of cyclical data submission and infirm sharing represented here by the data QA QC and interim sharing steps in the date of submission step you will begin uploading data as it reaches your initial submission dates for it is defined in the date expected list either in cumulative biannual submission Cycles when published or at the project and date in the QA QC step each submission of data has run through a set of automated quality checks that NDA developed and you'll be given the opportunity to correct any. acted issues then in the interim stick sharing stage your ongoing cumulative data set is Cher typically 4 months after submission this process then repeats biannually over the course of your Grant if you are collecting fmri eye-tracking ohmic c e g e g g or any other type of event based or neural signal recordings data you will need to use at the experiment definition pool during your submission you can access this in the experiments tab of your NDA collection the experiment definition provides information on acquisition processing and other parameters that will help researchers performing secondary analysis understand how your data was collected once it is completed you will receive an ID number that you will need to enter in Associated subject records when uploading Associated raw files each experiment type has a similar interface and preloaded options when completing all required sales keep in mind that the purpose of the definition is to provide as much information is necessary to recreate the experiment so here you will see what the experiment definition looks like you can see the equipment and scanner to check list that you can choose from the different software stimuli and then you would just add new as you go along again when you get to this process and after you've completed your data expected list you will be assigned a data curator to your project who can help you with any of these things if you have any questions again just contact the NBA help desk will also take a quick look at the NDA study which is how you'll do fine Publications in the system and I them back to the underlying data in NDA an NDA study describes an analysis along with the cohorts measures and methods of analytics and references that underlying Source data from the NDA collection so others can access data specific to a publication or other public disclosure disclosure of results data are shared a granular level for example specific outcome measures by specific time point when the NDA study is created allowing others to let me start over on this data or share data granular level when the NDA study is created which allows other unpublished data that are not scheduled for sharing to remain private the deal is issued for each NDA study and others are expected to reference the location of the data in the publication sing the doi to do this authors are expected to contact the NDA help desk at NDA help at mail. Nh.gov when a manuscript is submitted for review so that an NDA study and the DUI can be issued and included with the actual publication a DUI for the underlying data may increase the visibility of your work be also wanted to mention a few resources available on the NDA website that can be helpful over the course of your project that are not necessarily part of any specific step in the data sharing life cycle the first of those is the NDA Search tool it is on her home page as shown with it you can search on text strings across the website content and DEA collections or studies as well as elements and structures in the NBA data dictionary and many other cat the second of these is the NDA query tool to query tool provides numerous ways you can filter and download data from the database it can be found on our website under the get data tabs you may have noticed some of the benefits of sharing data using NDA you can use NDA as your data manager to a certain extent we have predefined data structure so there is no need for you to do upfront work or work with another electronic data capture system using NDA data structures upfront can be extremely useful everyone wants to start with Annalise clean data the NDA validation tool and post submission qaqc processes can help the quality of your data many projects have multiple performance and wish to share data among these sites submitting to NDA facilitates access by all investigators working on a project even before the data have been shared with others you can control who gets access to the data wallet is in the private State beta are portable regardless of your location or institutional affiliation so you don't have to send spreadsheets to collaborators or carry data around on a flash drive data are also secure and DEA staff have implemented comprehensive backup protocols to ensure that data are never lost storage costs are not an issue because NDA absorbs the cost and there's no charge to submitters or users to access the data and he a study and the resulting DOI have the potential to increase the ability to increase the ability and visibility of your work so just as a recap these are the things that you need to do next first review your NDA sharing terms and conditions complete the NDA data submission agreement and upload or email it to NDA provide your staff with collection privileges create the data expected list in the NBA collection plan ahead for collecting pii that is needed to create a new ID remember this is information found exactly as it is on the birth certificate ensure data sharing is covered in the consents and register for additional upcoming webinars so as I mentioned today's webinar is at its conclusion we will provide a recording tomorrow in a follow-up email and I encourage you to review it for our next webinars as well as to share it with your colleagues as always you should feel free to contact us if you have any questions if you have questions about today's webinar please email them to us and we'll get back to you as soon as we possibly as soon as we possibly can to get answers to you their resources on her website such as video tutorials that walk you through step-by-step of many of these processes so if you have questions just reach out to us and let us know we also like to know how we're doing I hope this wasn't too painful for you to listen to but I appreciate it very much I'm going to leave the screen up for a little while so that you can copy down the information again you can create request request a copy of the slide deck if you find that helpful as well thank you everyone for attending today again please submit any questions and feedback to our help desk and EA help at mail. Nh.gov thanks a lot and have a great day
